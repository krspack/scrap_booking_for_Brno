# scrap_booking_for_Brno
The script downloads from booking.com the capacities and prices of all accommodation in Brno.

The scraped price means the LOWEST price per person per night that the hotel has available for that day. There may be other rooms for hihger prices available in the same hotel. 

The script needs a list of hotels, stored in json format, in the same directory. This list has been downloaded using https://apify.com/voyager/booking-scraper (freemium) and can be downloaded there again at any time for more recent data.
